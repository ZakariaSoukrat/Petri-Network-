========

The original PNE can be downloaded from [www.pneditor.org](http://www.pneditor.org/)

This instance is the result of a student project by Joris Thaveau for teaching purpose.

It is a simplified Petri net editor that allows the editing of many PetriNet models.

To use:

1. Run org.pneditor.editor.Main as a Java application
2. Select the model used (the menu scans the org.pneditor.petrinet.adapters folder to build a list of available models and adapters). initial and imta are available. Places and transitions are displayed in different ways.
3. Edit the PetriNet and fire transitions.

You may experiment some unexpected exceptions. Especially if you mix models.

this project contains a model of petriNet developed by Zakaria Soukrat & Azhar Elboughazaoui
